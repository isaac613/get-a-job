# Get A Job — project conventions

This is a React + Vite + Supabase career operating system for business students entering the Israeli tech market. A practicum pilot runs Aug–Nov 2026 with 100 students.

## Architecture pointers

- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + TanStack Query. Pages live in `src/pages/` and auto-register via `src/pages.config.js` (do not edit `pages.config.js` manually — files are auto-registered).
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Edge Functions in Deno + Storage + RLS). Project ref `ilmqmodklutztuybsvwd`.
- **Edge functions:** in `supabase/functions/<slug>/index.ts`. Deploy via `supabase functions deploy <slug> --project-ref ilmqmodklutztuybsvwd`.
- **Domain libraries** (Israeli market context, role/skill graphs): `supabase/functions/<slug>/shared/libraries/00_role_library.ts` (170 roles), `01_skill_library.ts`, plus proof signals + role-skill mappings. Each function copies the libraries it needs — keep them in sync if editing.
- **Tier scoring:** `src/lib/scoreApplication.js` (`tierFromScores`) mirrors the goal-aware logic in `generate-career-analysis` (`assignTierWithGoal`). LLM-derived alignment uses tighter thresholds than the deterministic path.

## Conventions

- Tests: `npm test` (Vitest). Build: `npm run build`. Lint: `npm run lint`. Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`. CI runs all four on every PR — keep green.
- Commits: conventional-commit style (`fix(tracker): …`, `feat(cv): …`). End with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- Never commit secrets. `.env.local` is gitignored and stays that way. Never embed credentials (PATs, API keys) in URLs or git remotes.
- Never auto-mutate canonical source-of-truth files (e.g., `00_role_library.ts`) — emit to drafts, require human promotion.
- Default to writing no comments. When you do, explain WHY (hidden constraint, subtle invariant), not WHAT.

## Team workflow (Eli + Isaac)

- **Branches:** work on `eli/<topic>` or `isaac/<topic>` (or `feature/<topic>`). Never push directly to `main`.
- **PRs:** open against `main`, fill out the template at `.github/pull_request_template.md`, get one approval from the other dev, squash-merge to keep `main` linear.
- **Conflicts:** the dev who opens the PR resolves conflicts before merge.
- **Picking up someone else's branch:** run `npm test && npm run build` before any commit. Don't trust that "it worked on their machine."
- **Domain libraries** (`supabase/functions/*/shared/libraries/*.ts`): edits require explicit cross-review by the other dev. These libraries drive multiple edge functions and silent divergence is a real risk.
- **`ROADMAP.md`:** keep updated. Move items between Done / In Progress / Up Next as work moves. If it's not in the roadmap, it's not happening.

## Lessons (reflection loop)

After any correction from the user that took **multiple attempts to land**, or any bug that surfaced because I missed something an earlier interaction should have taught me, append an entry to `tasks/lessons.md` with this format:

```
---
YYYY-MM-DD — short title
Trigger: what surfaced the lesson (1 sentence)
What I did wrong: the specific misstep — not a generalisation
Rule for next time: actionable rule, written so future-me can follow it
---
```

Keep entries to ~5 lines. The file is for me to read at the start of any session that touches the relevant area, not exhaustive documentation.

Read `tasks/lessons.md` before starting non-trivial work in: tier scoring, LLM prompt engineering, edge-function deploys, role/skill library edits, onboarding flow.

## Verification before completion

For any P0 claim about security (RLS, auth, data integrity), indexes, or schema correctness — **verify against the live system** (`pg_class`, `pg_indexes`, `information_schema`) before treating it as actionable. Two parallel agent audits this session reported "missing RLS on 9 tables"; ground-truth showed all 12 tables had RLS enabled with policies. Trust but verify.

## Data sourcing for job suggestions

`generate-job-suggestions` deliberately calls **only** these RapidAPI endpoints:

- **`active-jobs-db.p.rapidapi.com/active-ats-7d`** — public ATS feeds (Comeet, Greenhouse, Lever, Workable, Workday, Ashby, BambooHR, iCIMS, etc.). Companies publish these for syndication — clean provenance with no LinkedIn relationship. **Primary path for Israel queries** (Comeet alone covers ~12k jobs across 600+ IL companies including monday.com, JFrog, AppsFlyer, SolarEdge).
- **`jsearch.p.rapidapi.com/search`** — fallback when Active Jobs DB returns no results, and primary for non-IL queries. Wraps Google for Jobs, which independently indexes postings across the web. **Counsel confirmed (2026-04-29):** consuming Google's index is a different legal model from direct LinkedIn scraping — Google's relationship with each indexed source is between Google and that source, not us.

**Never call `linkedin-job-search-api.p.rapidapi.com/*`.** This is a *separate* Fantastic.Jobs product that scrapes LinkedIn directly with no disclosed license. Treat as Proxycurl-equivalent risk. Our codebase does not reference this endpoint and must not.

Per-job `source` field is captured in DB (`'jsearch'` | `'active-jobs-db'`) for audit. Pre-pilot, verify the production source mix:

```sql
SELECT source, count(*) FROM job_suggestions GROUP BY source;
```

If a future change introduces another data feed, document the upstream provenance in this section before merging.
