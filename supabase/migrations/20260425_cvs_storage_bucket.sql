-- The generate-tailored-cv edge function uploads generated PDFs to a Supabase
-- Storage bucket named "cvs" under the path `{user.id}/{role}_CV_{timestamp}.pdf`.
-- The bucket was created by hand in the dashboard on the live project, so a
-- fresh clone would be missing it. This migration creates the bucket and RLS
-- policies so the schema is reproducible.
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run.
