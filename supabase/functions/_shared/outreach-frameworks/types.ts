// types.ts — typed shapes for the Outreach Conversation Coach (PR #35).
//
// The conversation-coach feature is multi-turn: the user picks a goal,
// describes the target person, and the AI coaches each DM turn (opening
// message, follow-ups when there's silence, next-response suggestions
// based on the recipient's reply).
//
// One row per (user, goal, target_person) combination in the
// linkedin_outreach_conversations table. The thread + status update on
// each turn; the goal is editable mid-thread per design decision 1A.

// 8 outreach goals locked in the migration CHECK constraint. Adding a
// goal later requires DROP/ADD CONSTRAINT in a new migration.
export type OutreachGoal =

  company?: string
  // Free-text relationship description — "alumni from Reichman 2024",

  // temperature for the message.

  // Anything specific that grounds the message — a shared event, a
  // mutual connection, a class they taught, a comment thread you both
  // engaged with. Critical for warm openers.

//   2. Continuing conversation: conversation_id provided, the AI loads
//      the row, reads goal + target + message_thread, and generates the
//      next AI suggestion based on thread state.
//
// In both modes, the response is a transient AI suggestion the user
// can edit / accept / regenerate.

  // of rapport first; this opener is just warming up the connection").
  // Empty string when no warm-up advice is needed.
  warm_up_advice: string
