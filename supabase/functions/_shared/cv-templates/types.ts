// One CV-build call needs: a theme (font + accent color, sector-derived),
// a style (ATS-Optimized vs Polished — chrome differences only, structure
// is identical), and feature toggles (currently just photo). Templates
// don't diverge structurally; they share the same buildCV() and the same
// section order. The style flag controls visual chrome (border rules,
// label case, header-block layout) without changing what data renders.

  // Calibri (tech/business default), Garamond (finance/law), Arial
  // (engineering). Per the visual-design research: each font is on the
  // current ATS-safe whitelist AND signals the right register for the
  // sector without reading as gimmicky.
  font: string
  // Single subtle accent color. Used ONLY in Polished style — for the
  // thin rule under the name and under section headings. Sector-tinted
  // hex per Design Shack 2025 + Resume Genius recruiter sentiment data
  // (62% say overdesign hurts perception → conservative tones only).
