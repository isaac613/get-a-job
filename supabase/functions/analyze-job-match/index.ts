// Source-controlled in commit fixing H1-H4. The deployed function previously
// existed only in the dashboard — this file imports it back into the repo
// alongside two behavioural fixes:
//
// 1. (H2) prompt now requests matched_requirements/missing_requirements as
//    arrays of {requirement, reason} / {requirement, gap} objects so the
//    JobMatchChecker.jsx renderer (which dereferences .requirement and
//    .reason / .gap on each item) actually displays content instead of
//    blanks with literal " — " separators.
//
// 2. (H3) URL-only mode (no pasted job_description) now returns an explicit
//    400 instead of letting the LLM hallucinate a fake job posting. Edge
//    runtimes can't fetch most job-board pages (auth walls, JS rendering,
//    bot protection) and the previous "inform the user you need text" prompt
//    instruction was unreliable — gpt-4o-mini frequently fabricated rather
//    than refused.

- "Senior": 5-8 years, "Senior X", "Sr. X", explicit "5+ years" or "6+ years".

CRITICAL: pick the lowest band that fits. Do NOT default to 60 as a "safe middle." The rubric is asymmetric on purpose — most roles a user could be hired for are NOT on the path to their stated 5-year goal, and scoring them in the 60-79 band misleads the user into pursuing dead-end work.

- 80-100: Direct stepping stone. Same role family as the target, OR a well-documented transfer path (e.g. APM → PM, Analyst → PM, Engineer → PM). The role exists primarily on the same career ladder as the goal.
- 60-79: Genuinely adjacent — a different role family, but one that hiring managers for the goal role explicitly value as preparation (e.g. UX Researcher → PM, Solutions Engineer → PM). Use this band ONLY when there's a real, common path, not just "transferable soft skills."
- 40-59: Tangentially useful. Some skills carry over but the role is on a different ladder; pivoting later would require restarting at entry-level.
- 20-39: Unrelated. Pursuing it pulls the user sideways and the experience does not signal goal-relevant capability to recruiters in the goal field.
- 0-19: Actively contradicts the trajectory. The role is on a competing/orthogonal career ladder. Examples for a Product Manager target: SDR/AE/sales roles, recruiting, customer support, accounting — these are NOT PM stepping stones, and a year spent in them is a year not spent building PM signal.

Common mistakes to AVOID:
- Rating any customer-facing role 60+ for a PM target just because "PMs talk to customers." Customer empathy is universal; that's not what makes a role PM-adjacent.
- Rating any sales role 40+ for a PM target just because "you learn the product." SDRs/AEs do not become PMs; the ladder is structurally different.
- Rating the SAME alignment as match_score. Match score and goal alignment are independent signals — a user can be a 90% fit for a job that's a 10% goal alignment.`
