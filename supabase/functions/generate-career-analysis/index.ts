Do not name, suggest, or mention any role above the user's cap in your reasoning, action_items, or alignment_to_goal text — if a Tier 3 aspirational role is shown, it's already within the cap.

Write in a supportive, actionable tone. Reference the user's specific experiences and skills. Do not invent facts about the user. Do not modify the titles, tiers, scores, matched_skills, or missing_skills values.`;

TIER DEFINITIONS (for your reasoning — the server has already assigned tiers):
- Tier 1: strong hirability NOW at a seniority the user could actually get + strong goal alignment — the best immediate next move
- Tier 2: strong hirability NOW but weak goal alignment — viable but pulls from the long-term path
- Tier 3: aspirational roles (usually one seniority step up or in a new family) that align with the 5-year goal — work toward these

SCORE INTERPRETATION:
- readiness_score is a hirability-adjusted fit (skill overlap × seniority-gap penalty × family-experience penalty). It answers "would a recruiter consider this person for this role right now?"
- raw_skill_overlap is the unadjusted skill match. If readiness_score is much lower than raw_skill_overlap, it means the role is above the user's current seniority OR outside their current role family — i.e. they have the skills on paper but lack the direct experience a hiring manager would look for.
- goal_alignment_score is separate: how well this role leads toward the 5-year goal.

${goalDisplay}

PRE-SCORED ROLE RECOMMENDATIONS (do not modify title, tier, scores, or skill lists):
${JSON.stringify(rolesForLLM, null, 2)}

For each role listed above, write:
1. reasoning: 2-3 sentences explaining why this user is/isn't a strong fit, referencing their specific experiences and skills. Mention both the fit score and the goal alignment score when relevant.
2. action_items: 2-3 concrete, specific next steps to close the skill gaps
3. alignment_to_goal: 1 sentence explaining the goal alignment score using the alignment_reason as a factual anchor (e.g. "natural transfer path", "same role family", "no clear connection")

Also write at the top level:
- overall_assessment: 2-3 sentences summarising the user's current position and strongest signals
- qualification_level: "Junior", "Mid-Level", or "Senior" based on their experience depth

Return JSON matching this exact structure:

  "overall_assessment": "string",
