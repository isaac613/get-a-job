**Generated:** 2026-05-08
**Source:** Full strategy session + deep research survey
**Purpose:** Single prioritized list of everything to install, wire, or set up before and after launch

## THIS WEEK (May 8-15) — Foundation

### Infrastructure (do first, highest leverage)

- [ ] **Wire Helicone as OpenAI base URL** — change base_url to https://oai.helicone.ai/v1 + add Helicone-Auth header across all 15 edge functions. Gives you instant cost tracking, latency monitoring, and 20-30% savings from prompt caching. Free 100k req/mo. ONE LINE CHANGE per function.

- [ ] **Wire Resend SMTP into Supabase Auth** — replaces Supabase's 2-emails-per-hour default. Without this, magic links WILL fail on launch day when 80 people sign up. Free 3k emails/mo.
