    id: "lessons",
    label: "Lessons learned",
    Icon: Lightbulb,
    description: "3–5 concrete lessons from a course, role, project, book, or event. Each lesson tied to a specific example you actually lived.",
    saveableHint: "Numbered lists with examples are the most-saved post format.",
  },
  {
    id: "milestone",
    label: "Career milestone",
    Icon: Award,
    description: "Share a career update — internship offer, role start, certification, graduation. Specific gratitude with named people works far better than generic excitement.",
    saveableHint: "Skip 'Excited to share' / 'Thrilled to announce' — these are algorithmically suppressed.",

    label: "Event / hackathon recap",
    Icon: Trophy,
    description: "Recap of a hackathon, conference, competition, workshop, or panel. Tag teammates with their specific contributions.",

    label: "Question for community",
    Icon: MessageCircleQuestion,
    description: "Genuinely ask for input on a decision. You'll be asked what you've already considered — questions that skip this read as lazy.",

  },
  {
    id: "observation",
    label: "Industry observation",
    Icon: Eye,
    description: "Your perspective on a trend in your target industry. Highest-risk format — easy to come off as overreach without a concrete example anchoring authority.",
