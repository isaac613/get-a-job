// Background scoring of applications via analyze-job-match.
//
// Fire-and-forget pattern — the caller does NOT await this function.
// The flow is: user adds an application, it appears in Tracker
// immediately with no AI Confidence and no tier shown, and ~3-8s later
// both fill in once analyze-job-match returns.
//
// Tier comes from BOTH match_score (JD fit) and goal_alignment_score
// (does this role advance the 5-year target?), mirroring the goal-aware
// formula in generate-career-analysis. Without alignment, a high-fit
// off-path role like an SDR for a Product Manager target wrongly landed
// in tier_1. When the user has no 5-year goal set, analyze-job-match
// omits goal_alignment_score and we fall back to fit-only thresholds.
//
// Wired into every code path that inserts an application (JobSuggestions,
// Tracker manual add, chat agent's Path B handler) plus the JD-save
// handler on ApplicationRow (so updating a JD re-scores). JobMatchChecker
// computes synchronously and uses the same tierFromScores helper.
//
// Failure semantics: on any error reaching analyze-job-match or writing
// the result, we set applications.tier_scoring_failed_at so the row's UI
// can swap "Calculating tier…" for a Retry button. Successful runs clear
// the field. Pre-2026-04-28 behavior was console.warn-only — silent
// failures left rows stuck on the placeholder forever.

// Fit-only fallback — used when the user has no 5-year goal so the LLM
// can't return alignment. Thresholds match FIT_ONLY_THRESHOLDS in
// generate-career-analysis (0.55/0.40/0.25). Exported as the inline
// helper for JobMatchChecker too, in case alignment is missing.

//   roleSeniority   — JD's required experience level (string, may be null)
//   userStage       — user's career stage: "early" | "mid" | "senior"
//
// Layered logic:
//   1. Seniority cap: if the role is above the user's stage ceiling, force
//      tier_3 (Work Toward) regardless of fit/alignment. A student can't be
//      hired into a Senior role today.
//   2. Goal-aware bands (when alignment is provided):
//        T1: strong fit + strong alignment  OR  adequate fit + very strong alignment
//        T2: viable fit but off-path
//        T3: aspirational — some skill foundation + on-path
//   3. Fallback to tierFromScore when alignment is null (no goal set).
//
// Thresholds are stricter than generate-career-analysis (0.70 vs 0.60 for
// T1 alignment) because LLM-derived alignment is noisier than the
// deterministic skill_transfer matrix and gpt-4o-mini tends to pick
// middle-of-rubric scores. See the SDR-for-PM bug for the calibration story.
