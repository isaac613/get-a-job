// Pure data + pure function shared between Onboarding.jsx and the test suite.
// Lifted out of Onboarding.jsx so the real cleanProfilePayload can be tested
// directly instead of via a stale inline stub (audit finding U1).
//
// Anything imported here MUST stay React-free — no hooks, no JSX, no Supabase
// client. The test suite runs without those.

// Initial shape for the React profile state during onboarding. Field defaults
// are deliberately the right TYPE for the corresponding DB column (text[] →
// [], jsonb → null/[], text → "", boolean → false). Auto-save sends the
// payload to Postgres; getting the type wrong here makes PostgREST reject the
// row update with "malformed array literal" or similar.
