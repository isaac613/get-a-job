# PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS — Get A Job

**Last updated: 2026-05-08 (after PR #36 — PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md established as living source of truth)**

This file is the **living source of truth** for the project. Read this first, then follow cross-references for depth.

**Every PR must update this file.** When the change is non-trivial — new feature, new edge function, new schema, sprint progress — append/edit the relevant section. The CLAUDE.md / ROADMAP.md / lessons.md files have one job each; this file is the index that ties them together. If you read this and something feels stale, fix it.

Cross-references:
- `CLAUDE.md` — coding conventions, branch + PR rules, commit format, lessons doctrine
- `ROADMAP.md` — week-by-week sprint plan with the v1/v2 cut table
- `tasks/lessons.md` — append-only log of "took multiple attempts" gotchas; read before non-trivial work in tier scoring, LLM prompts, edge-function deploys, role/skill libraries, onboarding
- `README.md` — local setup + env vars
- `docs/research/linkedin-post-performance.md` — research findings that ground every LinkedIn-related prompt
- `docs/strategy/installation-checklist.md` + `docs/strategy/design-strategy.md` — prioritized tool/MCP/skill/API installation roadmap and the UX/sidebar/display-philosophy reference for the Wk 6 visual redesign

## What this app is

Get A Job is an AI-powered career operating system for **business students at Reichman University entering the Israeli tech market.** Pilot launches **June 15, 2026** (80 own-pilot users via WhatsApp groups), then a Reichman 10-student practicum in August, then the larger 100-student Reichman practicum Aug–Nov 2026.

Target users are not generic job seekers — they are early-career business students (CS, Marketing, BD, RevOps, PM, CSM, Solutions, GTM kinds of roles, not engineering). All product decisions are anchored to that audience: reply rates, tone, role library, voice rules, framework defaults.

Pilot is **CONFIRMED** — Reichman professor + Dr. Miller personally vouching. Internship Company Picker is a P0 add to original scope.

## Architecture at a glance

**Frontend:** React 18 + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + TanStack Query + sonner (toasts). Pages in `src/pages/` auto-register via `src/pages.config.js` (do not edit `pages.config.js` manually). Routing: BrowserRouter; `createPageUrl(pageName)` from `@/utils` builds page paths.

**Backend:** Supabase. Project ref `ilmqmodklutztuybsvwd`.
- Postgres + RLS (4-policy own-row pattern: SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE all `(SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id`)
- Auth (email + magic link)
- Edge Functions in Deno (`supabase/functions/<slug>/index.ts`)
- Storage (CV PDFs, etc.)
- Migrations in `supabase/migrations/<YYYYMMDD>_<slug>.sql`

**LLM provider:** OpenAI. Two model tiers:
- `gpt-4o-mini` for cheap classification / extraction (Story extraction, tier scoring)
- `gpt-4o` for generation surfaces (CV, posts, comments, outreach, career analysis)
- `response_format: json_object` for any structured output

**Domain libraries** (Israeli market context, ~170 roles + skills + proof signals + role-skill mappings): `supabase/functions/<slug>/shared/libraries/00_role_library.ts` etc. Each function copies the libraries it needs — keep in sync if editing. Edits require explicit cross-review by the other dev.

**Tier scoring:** `src/lib/scoreApplication.js` (`tierFromScores`) mirrors `assignTierWithGoal` in `generate-career-analysis`. LLM-derived alignment uses tighter thresholds than the deterministic path.

---

## Edge functions (15)

All under `supabase/functions/<slug>/index.ts`. Each writes per-call metrics via `_shared/metrics.ts` (PR #6).

| Slug | Model | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ai-chat` | gpt-4o | Career Agent multi-turn chat. Emits `SUGGESTED_*_JSON` blocks (TASKS, ROADMAP_CHANGES, APPLICATION_ACTIONS, CV_GENERATION, AGENT, STORY_CAPTURE) the frontend renders as cards |
| `analyze-job-match` | gpt-4o | Score a JD against user profile → `match_score` + `goal_alignment_score` + `required_seniority`. Drives tier auto-assignment |
| `extract-proof-signals` | gpt-4o-mini | Pull proof signals (metrics, named tools, named outcomes) from free-text inputs |
| `extract-story-from-text` | gpt-4o-mini | STAR extraction from user-pasted experience text. 3-layer anti-fabrication. Powers Story Bank |
| `generate-career-analysis` | gpt-4o | Tiered role recommendations (`career_roles` table) — Tier 1/2/3 with rationale |
| `generate-job-suggestions` | gpt-4o | JSearch / Active Jobs DB → scored job suggestions for the user's roles |
| `generate-learning-paths` | gpt-4o | Course recommendations to close skill gaps (Coursera + LinkedIn Learning affiliate links) |
| `generate-linkedin-comment` | gpt-4o | **PR #34.** Paste a post → 3 substantive comment options grounded in user's real experience. Anti-fab: empty options + `no_fit_reason` when nothing genuine to say |
| `generate-linkedin-content` | gpt-4o | Earlier LinkedIn content function (pre-Phase-2) — likely deprecate path TBD |
| `generate-linkedin-outreach-message` | gpt-4o | **PR #35.** Multi-turn outreach coach across 8 goals. Two modes: new conversation (insert + opener) or continue (load thread + append `new_them_reply` or `mark_as_sent` → next AI turn). Emits `warm_up_advice` for premature asks. Programmatic anti-pattern detection in post-process |
| `generate-linkedin-post` | gpt-4o | **PR #32–33.** 7 post types (project / lessons / milestone / recap / observation / question / free_form). Per-type framework + POST_VOICE_RULES injected. Refinement mode supported (UPDATE same row) |
| `generate-tailored-cv` | gpt-4o | CV generation with STORY BANK PRECEDENCE — verbatim metric/tool binding from `stories` table. DOCX rendering via template engine (PR #21+) |
| `generate-tasks` | gpt-4o | Personalised weekly action plan |
| `import-linkedin-archive` | n/a | Wk 4 LinkedIn import (zip upload + Connections.csv parser). Schema designed; awaiting Eli's archive |
| `lookup-role-skills` | n/a | Static lookup against `role_library` + `skill_library` |

**Rate limits:** all generation surfaces are gated via `serviceClient.rpc('check_rate_limit', ...)`. Defaults: 60/hour for posts/comments/outreach, lower for CV (expensive call).

**Deploy:** via Supabase CLI (`supabase functions deploy <slug> --project-ref ilmqmodklutztuybsvwd`) OR via Supabase Management API multipart endpoint when CLI is unavailable. The token is stashed at `/tmp/.gaj_supabase_token` for current sessions; see `tasks/lessons.md` 2026-05-05 entry.

## Voice rules (5 constants)

All in `supabase/functions/_shared/voice-rules.ts`. Each is a long string injected into the system prompt of the relevant edge function. Source-of-truth voice across surfaces.

| Constant | Surface | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CV_VOICE_RULES` | `generate-tailored-cv` | Resume voice — concrete > generic, named outcomes, specific metrics, active voice |
| `LINKEDIN_VOICE_RULES` | LinkedIn profile content | Headline + summary + experience bullets — same anti-fluff discipline as CV |
| `POST_VOICE_RULES` | `generate-linkedin-post` | Hook rules, engagement-bait blacklist (no "Agree?" / "Comment YES if…"), suppressed openers ("Excited to share", "Thrilled to announce", "Humbled to") |
| `COMMENT_VOICE_RULES` | `generate-linkedin-comment` | 50–150 word sweet spot, anti-platitude list, Israeli direct register |
| `OUTREACH_VOICE_RULES` | `generate-linkedin-outreach-message` | The outreach contract (3 questions recipient asks), 50–150 word openers, ≤200 char connection notes, anti-pattern list including "I hope this finds you well" + variants, the ask-temperature principle, anti-fabrication with explicit examples |

**The replace-banned-vocab-with-positive-voice-rules refactor was PR #20.** Old approach (banned vocab lists) didn't work — the model would pattern-match around the banned words but keep the underlying voice. Voice-rules approach gives the model what TO write, not just what NOT to.

**Anti-pattern detection.** For OUTREACH specifically, the model still slips template phrases ("I hope you're doing well") even with hard-rule injection — these are too high-frequency in training data. PR #35 added programmatic post-process detection in `sanitizeSuggestion` that scans for ~10 known anti-patterns and surfaces warning chips into `suggestion.warnings`. The user sees the warning above the editable text and rewrites before sending. This is a pattern worth replicating for any other surface where the model resists rule-following on common phrases.

## Sprint status — Wk 3 remaining + Wk 4 queue

The full week-by-week is in `ROADMAP.md`. This is the working slice.

### Wk 3 remaining

**Eli (Thu–Fri slots):**
- **Daily Action Card** — schema + `generate-daily-action` edge function (priority logic + LLM picker)
- **Admin chat log viewer** — `chat_messages` + `conversations` join; new `admin_chat_logs(p_user_id uuid, p_limit int)` RPC; card on `/admin` with student dropdown rendering threaded message list with pretty-printed `suggested_*_json` blocks
- **Admin story browser** — `stories` table; new `admin_stories_browse(p_user_id uuid NULL, p_limit int)` RPC; card on `/admin` with student dropdown + story list (title, source surface, STAR fields, metrics, skills_demonstrated, tools_used, italicised `extraction_notes`); raw-text vs STAR side-by-side where data permits, for prompt-tuning signal

**Isaac (Wk 3, 2.5 days):**
- **Mon — Story Bank Phase 2:** AddInformation Experience tab inline stories + quick-add modal
- **Wed — Daily Action Card UI** on Home dashboard (Done / Snooze / Dismiss actions)
- **Fri — Daily Action calibration loop:** dismissed-type backoff in priority weighting

### Wk 4 queue (May 26 – June 1)

**Eli:**
- **Mon–Tue — LinkedIn import:** schema (`linkedin_imports` + `linkedin_connections` + `linkedin_change_events`) + zip upload edge function + Connections.csv parser (others if time)
- **Wed — Connection cross-reference:** match user's connections against Internship Picker company list. "X connections at Atera" UI on Tracker rows
- **Thu — Internship Finder schema:** `internship_profiles` + `companies` + `company_targets` + `faculty_practicum_companies` + `practicum_mode` onboarding toggle + `generate-internship-profile` edge function
- **Fri:** buffer + integration test

**Isaac (Wk 4, 2.5 days):**
- **Mon — `match-internship-companies` edge function** (scoring against profile)
- **Wed — `/Practicum` page UI:** profile display + kanban pipeline (basic — exploring → outreach → interview → offered)
- **Fri — Career Agent practicum prompt addition** + `SUGGESTED_COMPANY_TARGET_JSON` parsing

**Wk 4 risk:** Internship Finder is normally 10 days; we're fitting ~4. v1 cuts already locked: no curated companies DB seed (job-board API only), no `draft-outreach-message` (defer post-launch), no faculty-provided list (manual entries). Phase 2 polish post-launch.

**Wk 4 hard dependency:** LinkedIn import depends on Eli's archive being requested in Wk 1. ~24h LinkedIn processing cooldown. If late, parser uses sample data and ships Connections-only v1.

## How to work with Claude Code

We're using Claude (Opus 4.7 in 1M-context mode) as a pair programmer in two surfaces: **Claude Code** (terminal — direct file edits, command execution, runs lint/build) and **Claude.ai** (browser — research, deep planning, prompt-writing). The patterns below are how we've actually worked in PRs #20–35.

### The ask-don't-tell pattern

When in doubt, Claude pauses and asks. This is non-negotiable for:
- **Decisions that change scope** — "should I add X?" not "I added X."
- **Decisions that lock in design** — "single-shot vs conversation thread for outreach?" not "I built the conversation thread."
- **Risky / hard-to-reverse actions** — `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, dropping tables, force-merging, sending public messages. Always confirm first.
- **Anything visible to others** — pushing branches, opening PRs, posting comments. Confirm scope first.

In Eli's auto-memory: "Surface decisions for confirmation; don't lock in unilaterally even when broader scope is approved." Claude mirrors that. If you find Claude diving into a multi-file change without checking, redirect — that's the signal that the prompt was under-scoped.

### Decision checkpoints

For non-trivial work, Claude pauses before building and surfaces numbered decisions:

```
Before I build, two design questions worth confirming:

1. Persistence model. A: ephemeral (no DB rows, regen each time). B: one row per
   conversation. Lean B because of decision 5A (editable bubbles).
2. Goal-edit mid-thread. A: lock once started. B: editable. Lean B per your earlier call.

If both leans are right, I'll proceed.
```

You answer "all confirmed, go" or redirect a specific decision. This pattern keeps Claude from spending 30 minutes building down a path you'd reject in 30 seconds.

Use it any time you're delegating something architectural. **Don't accept "I'll figure it out as I go" from Claude on architectural calls** — that's where most rework comes from.

### The full-CI-before-push rule

Per `tasks/lessons.md` 2026-05-06 entry: `vite build` ≠ ESLint. CI runs `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run build` — three separate gates. Before any push:

```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run build
```

The ~10s extra is cheaper than a failed CI + push-fix cycle. Typecheck is currently `continue-on-error: true` in CI (shadcn Button/Input typedef issues blocking baseline cleanup) — but lint and build are blocking gates.

### Key files to read before starting

When asking Claude to work in an unfamiliar area, point it at the right files:

| Working on | Read first |
|---|---|
| LinkedIn Posts | `docs/research/linkedin-post-performance.md`, `_shared/post-frameworks/`, `_shared/voice-rules.ts` (POST_VOICE_RULES) |
| LinkedIn Comments | `_shared/voice-rules.ts` (COMMENT_VOICE_RULES), the research doc sections 5-6 |
| LinkedIn Outreach | `_shared/outreach-frameworks/`, `_shared/voice-rules.ts` (OUTREACH_VOICE_RULES) |
| CV generation | `_shared/cv-templates/`, the CV polish PR series #23–#29 |
| Tier scoring | `src/lib/scoreApplication.js`, `generate-career-analysis/index.ts`, `tasks/lessons.md` 2026-04-28 entry |
| Edge function deploy | `tasks/lessons.md` 2026-05-05 entry |
| Schema migrations | `supabase/migrations/` — pick a recent one matching your pattern (RLS, indexes, triggers) |

### Commit + PR conventions

From `CLAUDE.md`:
- Conventional commits: `feat(area):`, `fix(area):`, `refactor(area):`, `docs(area):`
- Co-author trailer: `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- Branch: `eli/<topic>` or `isaac/<topic>` — never push to main
- PR template: `.github/pull_request_template.md` — fill out What & Why, Test Plan, Notes for the reviewer
- Squash-merge to keep main linear
- Cross-review required for `_shared/libraries/` edits

---

## Tools / skills we use

The full toolkit across both surfaces. Isaac, you have access to all of these.

### Web research (Claude.ai — deep research mode)

Long-running multi-source research. Good for: industry data we don't already know, validating claims before they ground product decisions. Used for the LinkedIn post performance research that became `docs/research/linkedin-post-performance.md` (~50 tool calls, multiple cross-validation passes).

**When to use:** before building a feature whose quality depends on external claims (reply rates, format defaults, recipient-side dynamics). Save the output as a `docs/research/<topic>.md` file in the repo so prompts can ground in it.

**Pattern:** Eli specifies the research scope in Claude.ai → Claude.ai produces a long-form findings doc with cross-validated / single-sourced / contested tagging → Eli pastes the doc into the repo via Claude Code → all related edge function prompts cite the doc as source.

### Web search + web fetch (Claude Code in-session)

For shallow lookups inside an active coding session — API docs, library version checks, "does Postgres support X." Faster than spinning up a Claude.ai research tab.

### Supabase MCP server (Claude.ai)

Direct Postgres queries against the live project. Used for migration verification (`select count(*) from pg_class where relrowsecurity = true`), schema introspection, debugging RLS. When MCP isn't loaded in a session, the fallback is the Supabase Management API + a personal access token stashed at `/tmp/.gaj_supabase_token` — see `tasks/lessons.md` 2026-05-05 entry.

### gh CLI (Claude Code terminal)

GitHub from the terminal — opening PRs, commenting on issues, listing PRs/issues, checking PR CI status. Used for every PR opened in PRs #30–35.

```bash
gh pr create --title "..." --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
...
EOF
)"
gh pr view <num>
gh pr checks <num>
gh issue list
```

### The prompt-writing pattern (Claude.ai → Claude Code)

When Eli wants Claude Code to do something complex, the workflow is:

1. **Eli describes intent in Claude.ai** (broader, more permissive thinking environment)
2. **Claude.ai drafts a Claude Code prompt** — usually framed as a question Claude Code should ask Eli back, with relevant context the prompt should include
3. **Eli reviews + tweaks the draft** in Claude.ai
4. **Eli pastes into Claude Code** — Claude Code now has a self-contained briefing

Why: Claude.ai is better at scoping work; Claude Code is better at executing it. Splitting the job by surface gives a higher-quality prompt than typing freeform into Claude Code. Use it for any architectural call, multi-PR sequence, or "I want to build X but I'm not sure of the right shape."

### The decision-checkpoint pattern (in any session)

Before non-trivial work, Claude surfaces numbered decisions with options + leans (described above under "How to work with Claude Code"). This is the explicit form of ask-don't-tell.

Eli has saved feedback: "Surface decisions for confirmation; don't lock in unilaterally even when broader scope is approved." If you're working with Claude and you notice it diving into multi-file work without checking architectural calls, redirect — the prompt was probably under-scoped.

### Other tools worth knowing

- **Claude Code's TaskCreate / TaskList** — internal task tracking within a session. Don't rely on it for cross-session memory; use ROADMAP.md for that.
- **Slash commands / skills** — `/loop` (recurring work), `/clear` (reset session), and any project-specific skills we add. Wk 5 ships a role-library research skill (Isaac).
- **Worktrees** — `Agent` tool with `isolation: "worktree"` runs an agent on an isolated copy of the repo. Useful for exploratory refactors that might not land. Not used much yet.

## Keeping this file alive

**Every PR updates this file.** Adding a new edge function? Add a row to the table. Shipping a feature? Update Sprint Status. Refactor changes a key file path? Update Key Files. New convention? Add a section or update CLAUDE.md and add the cross-reference here.

The PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`) has a checkbox for this — added in PR #36. If you read this file and something feels stale, that's the signal — fix it in your next PR.

When the file gets too long (current target: <800 lines), split. The split rule: anything that has its own evolution rhythm (lessons, research, sprint plan) lives in its own file and is cross-referenced from here.
